Hello Yogesh sir,

I am Prashant from your September-22 batch, recently our Advanced DSA completed and I need some guidance,
we had 4 Advanced DSA section, out of which 2 was taken from you & later we completed through Umang sir batch..

I am getting confused with how/where to start for revising concepts along with clearing few backlogs, to be very precise on my backlogs on Advanced DSA:
I need to watch hardly 4-5 complete lecture recordings, as I have tried my best to attend almost all classes live by maintaining notes.
I need to solve around 60 assignment questions from like from all topics maximum  I have backlog of either 1-3 problems to solve.

I want to revise the topics & also clear these backlogs in very good manner so that it helps me remembering the concepts and apply which I am feeling difficult now. Due to my office work and some problem in my family I was not able to give time properly but somehow managed to finish DSA. I tried mentor connect but wasn't that helpful, so please help sir.

I am feeling low at this point of time, but still I am eager to learn and confident that I will do, please help me with how can start revising  and what problems should I solve from interview perspective, any suggestions or guidance will help me sir .. 

Considering I have 50-60 days of time for doing this DSA revision, please help me, I am attaching screenshots of my Advanced DSA dashboard for your reference.
